# Dynamic Table using JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic HTML table using JavaScript. The table is populated with data defined in the `script.js` file.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and the script link.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file that dynamically generates the table.
- `style.css`: (Optional) CSS file for styling the table.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the files into a new project folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the table.
3. If you have the Live Server extension in VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** for a better experience.
